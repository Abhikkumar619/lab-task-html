            <p align="center" face="Times New Roman">The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone.

                  a resident<br> of www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 homestead community on 
                  the Internet, might just<br> be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your 
                  account for some benign<br> Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net
                   for more such accounts!<br>
                Surprised? Or scared
            </p>

            Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got exactly<br> 108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet and 23<br> online passwords.
